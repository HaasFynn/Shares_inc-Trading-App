Remake of my previous project [Shares inc.](https://github.com/HaasFynn/shares.inc.git)

Problem was that the code wasn't seperated enough and the refactoring would have taken to long. Now I try it with the
Building System Gradle and Hibernate for my Database connection.


The branching/commiting may be a bit wrong. Reason for that is that i had problems with certain changes and manual rebaseing. This Issues occures mostly while visualizing my project with javaFX**.

**Current:**
