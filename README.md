# Shares inc. 2
### Remake of my previous project [Shares inc.](https://github.com/HaasFynn/shares.inc.git)

Problem was that the code wasn't seperated enough and the refactoring would have taken to long. Now I try it with the
Building System Gradle and Hibernate for my Database connection.


The branching/commiting may be a bit wrong. Reason for that is that i had problems with certain changes and manual rebasing. This Issues occures mostly while visualizing my project with javaFX**.

## **Currently:**

## Database
To use the database you can import the __*/database/shares.sql*__ into your MySQl-Server.
After that you need to configure the hibernate credentials in the src/main/resources/hibernate.properties file
